## Getting started 

Every path through our docs has a curated journey to help you find your footing. Whether it's design, development, or distributing your apps to the world, we've got you covered. 

### Mixed Reality for HoloLens

We recommend starting with the **Mixed Reality basics** and moving on from there:

* [Getting started with Mixed Reality](mixed-reality-docs/mr-dev-docs/discover/get-started-with-mr.md)

If you're interested in the **design** side of things:

* [Start designing and prototyping](mixed-reality-docs/mr-dev-docs/design/design.md)

When you're ready to start **developing**, choose the engine and device that best suits your needs:

* [Introduction to Mixed Reality development](mixed-reality-docs/mr-dev-docs/develop/development.md)

For engine-specific content, choose one of the following paths:

* [Unity development overview](mixed-reality-docs/mr-dev-docs/develop/unity/unity-development-overview.md)
* [Unreal development overview](mixed-reality-docs/mr-dev-docs/develop/unreal/unreal-development-overview.md)
* [Native (OpenXR) development overview](mixed-reality-docs/mr-dev-docs/develop/native/directx-development-overview.md)

When you're finally ready to get your app out to your users:

* [Distributing your apps](mixed-reality-docs/mr-dev-docs/distribute/distribute-overview.md)
