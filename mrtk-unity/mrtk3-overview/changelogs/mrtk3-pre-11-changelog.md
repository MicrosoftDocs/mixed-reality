# Changelog for MRTK3 pre.11

## [pre.11] - 2022-09-12 - [`fa26baf`](https://github.com/MixedRealityToolkit/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/commit/fa26baf)

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/). The full release announcement is available [here](https://github.com/microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/discussions/11002) under the [releases category of the discussions tab in our repo](https://github.com/microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/discussions/categories/releases).

### Added

- Added a unified `IPoseSource` interface for sharing pose logic across several components
- Added support support for Unity's Project Validation system
- Added 3D app icon setting for UWP
- Added menu items to intelligently create canvas-based buttons in the hierarchy
- Added BurstAotSettings to the sample Unity project
- Added the ability to load controller models from the platform
- Added `CameraFOVChecker` from MRTK2

### Changed

- **Breaking:** `CameraCache` is now removed in favor of Unity's performant `Camera.main` implementation
- **Breaking:** The UX prefabs are now split into two packages: `MRTK UX Components` and `MRTK UX Components (Non-Canvas)`
- **Breaking:** Changed the default color space to Linear and adjusted materials accordingly
- **Breaking:** Removed empty `GazeController`
- Updated MRTK3 Core Definitions' dependencies to require Unity's XR Core Utilities 2.1.0-pre.1
- Updated the Mixed Reality OpenXR plugin to 1.5.0
- Updated the Unity OpenXR plugin to 1.5.1
- Moved to a custom `AndroidManifest.xml` file to enable `TouchScreenKeyboard` on Meta Quest
- Improved the visual and default configuration of TabView
- Refactored `HandBasedPoseSource` out of `HandJointPoseSource`
- Updated `InterfaceSelector` to use Unity `TypeCache`
- Updated Microsoft.Unity.Analyzers.dll to 1.14.0
- Updated dependencies in package manifests
- Removed old No Pre Init loader
- Updated FollowJoint to use serialization callbacks for migration
- Moved the magic window sample into its own scene
- Updated hand menu & near menu prefabs and examples to be canvas-based
- Updated tracking state mapping for base hand controller prefab
- Obsoleted `ArticulatedHandController`'s `PinchPose`
- Improved reset logic for hand data
- Removed duplicate `PlayspaceUtilities.ReferenceTransform.rotation` application in `MRTKRayInteractor`

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue in StateViz preventing it from keeping track of individual colors
- Fixed a warning message from the cheese model
- Fixed a warning message from the MRTK Logo model
- Fixed some physics issues related to `ObjectManipulator` and the `HandInteractionExample` scene
- Fixed incorrect transition time and missing font icon reference in the Action Button prefab
- Fixed eye gaze simulation when XR isn't enabled

## Known issues

When the following conditions are met:

- Oculus OpenXR is selected as the Play Mode OpenXR Runtime for the standalone platform, and
- Initialize XR on Startup is checked for the standalone platform, and
- The computer is not connected to a headset (via cable or wireless)

... Unity editor may frequently freeze in play mode. This is a Unity bug introduced in Unity OpenXR plugin 1.5.
To work around this issue:

- use a non-Oculus Play Mode OpenXR Runtime for the standalone platform, or
- uncheck Initialize XR on Startup under **Edit** > **Project Settings** > **XR Plug-in Management** > **Standalone** while iterating in the editor via play mode, or
- connect to a headset before entering play mode in the editor.

## Breaking changes

- The UX prefabs are now split into two packages: `MRTK UX Components` and `MRTK UX Components (Non-Canvas)`
  - Up until this point, our RectTransform-based (preferred) UX components were jumbled in with our non-RectTransform-based (static) controls, which caused confusion and frustration
  - Now the UX prefabs are separated into two packages based on their use of Canvas/RectTransform. This will allow for better clarity for developers.
  - **Action item: if you're currently using any UX prefabs/components that aren't canvas-based, make sure you explicitly select `MRTK UX Components (Non-Canvas)` when updating in the Mixed Reality Feature Tool.**
- Changed the color space of the sample project to linear and adjusted materials accordingly
  - Optimized major UI-related materials and MRTK standard materials for use in linear color space. Their look in the gamma color space will be slightly different.
  - For more information on linear vs. gamma color space, see [Unity's documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/LinearRendering-LinearOrGammaWorkflow.html).
- `CameraCache` is now removed from MRTK in favor of Unity's performant `Camera.main` implementation
  - As of Unity 2020.2 (older than our minimum Unity version requirement for MRTK3), Camera.main has had some [massive performance improvements](https://blog.unity.com/technology/new-performance-improvements-in-unity-2020-2)!
  - `Camera.main` never took more than 0.0ms in in-editor profiler tests
- Removed empty `GazeController`
  - All properties in this class have been deprecated. `ArticulatedHandController` provides equivalent functionality for each pinching hand.
