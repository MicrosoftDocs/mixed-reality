- Deprecated `PlayspaceUtilities.ReferenceTransform`, see `PlayspaceUtilities.XROrigin.CameraFloorOffsetObject` and `PlayspaceUtilities.TransformPose(Pose pose)` ([#11035](https://github.com/microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/issues/11035))

- Removed extraneous ProxyInteractors from sample scenes ([#11035](https://github.com/microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/issues/11035))
- Refactored input simulator to use `Pose` structs for internally managing device and HMD poses ([#11035](https://github.com/microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/issues/11035))
- Changed `SqueezableBoxVisuals` to allow no box renderer ([#11087](https://github.com/microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/issues/11087))
- Moved some leftover scripts from `uxcomponents` to `uxcore` ([#11090](https://github.com/microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/issues/11090))

- Fixed bugs with how constraints were computed for ObjectManipulators with off-center host transforms ([#11086](https://github.com/microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/issues/11086))

## Known issues

- Ray reticles and proximity lights can still jitter in some contexts due to update order issues

## Breaking changes

- The MRTK XR rig has been significantly changed; the user's head will now be at their true, floor-calibrated height, or 1.6m on platforms that don't offer floor-height-calibration.
  - The content in your application will either need to be raised to head height, or if true head height is not desired for your application, select Device-relative mode in the `XROrigin`'s Tracking Origin Mode and set the vertical offset to zero meters.
- We've simplified the hand menu and near menu prefabs; we don't officially offer individual prefabs for each dimension of menu. This removal might break some prefab references, so check out the `OldPrefabs.zip` attached below if you need copies of the old prefabs to fix your references.
  - [OldPrefabs.zip](https://github.com/microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/files/9834344/OldPrefabs.zip)
- We've removed the environment package. We recommend using Unity's built-in support for playspace boundary queries instead, as well as ARFoundation's `ARMeshManager` for scene reconstruction.
