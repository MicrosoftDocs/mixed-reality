# Starting from the MRTK3 template project

The easiest way to acquire and try out MRTK3 is to explore our preconfigured project which contains references to all of the current MRTK3 packages. Clone our project at [our GitHub repo](https://github.com/microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/tree/mrtk3) and check out the `mrtk3` branch. After that, you can simply launch Unity (2021.3.4f1 or newer) on the `MRTKDevTemplate` project under `UnityProjects` and start playing with the [sample scenes](scenes.md) in the Editor by using remoting or deploying them to devices.

If you work with Git using the command line, you can clone the repo while specifying the `mrtk3` branch: `git clone --branch mrtk3 https://github.com/microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity.git`

For information on the sample scenes included in the preview, see [Exploring MRTK3 Sample Scenes](../exploring-features/scenes.md).
