# MRTK3 input

Input in MRTK3 is mainly routed through two paths: [Unity's input system](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@latest) and MRTK subsystems. Unity's input system is used for everything that it supports, from controller buttons and thumbsticks to controller/hand pointer poses. MRTK subsystems exist for other pieces of data that's needed for a broad set of interactions, like hand joints and speech.
