# Slider &#8212; MRTK3

![Slider example](../../../mrtk3-overview/images/UXBuildingBlocks/MRTK_UX_v3_Slider.png)

Sliders are UI components that allow you to continuously change a value by moving a slider on a track. Sliders can be interacted with using Poke, Grab, Ray, Gaze-Pinch, or any other valid interaction in XRI or MRTK3.

As with other interactables in MRTK, the main Slider interactable doesn't render any visuals. You must combine the Slider script with a visuals script, such as `CanvasSliderVisuals`.

## Layout

When using Sliders in a RectTransform context, the start and end positions are calculated by the RectTransform layout system. The `CanvasSliderVisuals` script will allow you to make these visuals horizontala or vertical.

## Audio

Sounds are currently provided by a dedicated audio driver script, `SliderSounds`. This script hooks into the Slider's events in order to play the audio clips at the appropriate times.
