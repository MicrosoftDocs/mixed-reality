# Mixed Reality Toolkit packages

The Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK) is a collection of packages that enable cross platform Mixed Reality application development by providing support for Mixed Reality hardware and platforms.

MRTK is available as [asset](#asset-packages) (.unitypackage) packages and via the [Unity Package Manager](#unity-package-manager).

## Asset packages

The MRTK asset (.unitypackage) can be downloaded from [GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/releases).

Some of the benefits of using asset packages include:

- Available for Unity 2018.4 and newer
- Easy to make changes to MRTK
  - MRTK is in the Assets folder

Some of the challenges are:

- MRTK is part of the project's Assets folder, leading to
  - Larger projects
  - Slower compilation times
- No dependency management
  - Customers are required to resolve package dependencies manually
- Manual update process
  - Multiple steps
  - Large (3000+ file) source control updates
  - Risk of losing changes made to MRTK
- Importing the examples package typically means including all examples

The available packages are:

- [Foundation](#foundation-package)
- [Extensions](#extensions-package)
- [Tools](#tools-package)
- [Test utilities](#test-utilities-package)
- [Examples](#examples-package)

These packages are released and supported by Microsoft from source code in the [mrtk_release](https://github.com/Microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/tree/mrtk_release) branch on GitHub.

### Foundation package

The Mixed Reality Toolkit Foundation is the set of code that enables your application to leverage common functionality across Mixed Reality Platforms.

| Folder | Component | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MRTK/Tests | |
| | TestUtilities | Methods to simplify creation of play mode tests, including hand simulation utilities. |

### Examples package

The examples package contains demos, sample scripts, and sample scenes that exercise functionality in the foundation package. This package contains the [HandInteractionExample scene](../features/example-scenes/hand-interaction-examples.md) (pictured below) which contains sample objects
that respond to various types of hand input (articulated and non-articulated).

![HandInteractionExample scene](../features/images/MRTK_Examples.png)

This package also contains eye tracking demos, which are [documented here](../features/example-scenes/eye-tracking-examples-overview.md)

More generally, any new feature in the MRTK should contain a corresponding example in the examples package, roughly following
the same folder structure and location.

> [!NOTE]
> The examples package requires Microsoft.MixedRealityToolkit.Unity.Foundation.

| Folder | Component | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MRTK/Examples | | |
| | Demos | Simple scenes illustrating one or two related features. |
| | Experimental | Demo scenes illustrating experimental features. |
| | StandardAssets | Common assets shared by multiple demo scenes. |

## Unity Package Manager

For experiences being created using Unity 2019.4 and newer, the MRTK is available via the [Unity Package Manager](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Packages.html).

Some of the benefits of using asset packages include:

- Smaller projects
  - Cleaner Visual Studio solutions
  - Fewer files to check in (MRTK is a simple reference in the `Packages/manifest.json` file)
- Faster compilation
  - Unity does not need to recompile MRTK during building
- Dependency resolution
  - Required MRTK packages are automatically installed when specifying packages with dependencies
- Easy update to new MRTK versions
  - Change the version in the `Packages/manifest.json` file

Some of the challenges are:

- MRTK is immutable
  - Cannot make changes without them being removed during package resolution
- MRTK does not support UPM packages with Unity 2018.4
