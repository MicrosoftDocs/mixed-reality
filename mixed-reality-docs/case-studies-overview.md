        **[3 HoloStudio UI and interaction design learnings](case-study-3-holostudio-ui-and-interaction-design-learnings.md)**<br>
        HoloStudio was one of the first apps for HoloLens. Because of this, we had to create new best practices for 3D UI and interaction design. We did this through a lot of user testing, prototyping, and trial and error.<br>

## Galaxy Explorer

Before Microsoft HoloLens shipped, we asked our developer community what kind of app they'd like to see an experienced internal team build for the new device. More than 5000 ideas were shared, and after a 24-hour Twitter poll, the winner was an idea called Galaxy Explorer.

## HoloTour

HoloTour for Microsoft HoloLens provides immersive 3D personal tours of iconic locations around the world. As the designers, artists, producers, audio designers, and developers working on this project found out, creating a convincingly real 3D rendering of a well-known location takes a unique blend of creative and technological wizardry.

## RoboRaid

In this mixed reality first-person shooter, use gaze and gesture to target enemies, and dodge incoming fire using natural movements. Spatial mapping turns each room into a unique game level, while spatial sound lets you use the entire room to play—even the spaces behind you.
