# Updating HoloLens

Your HoloLens will automatically download and install system updates whenever it is plugged-in and connected to Wi-Fi, even when it is in standby. However, you can also trigger a system update manually if there is one available.

## Manual update

To perform a manual update:
* Open the **Settings** app.
* Navigate to **Update & Security** > **Windows Update**.
* Select the **Check for updates** button.

If an update is available, it will start downloading the new version. Once the download is complete, select the **Restart Now** button to trigger the installation. If your device is below 40% and not plugged in, restarting will not start installing the update.

While your HoloLens is installing the update, it will display spinning gears and a progress indicator. Do not turn off your HoloLens during this time. It will reboot automatically once it has completed the installation.

You can verify the system version number by opening the **Settings** app and selecting **System** and then **About**. HoloLens currently supports applying only one update at a time, so if your HoloLens is more than one version behind the latest you may need to run through the update process multiple times to get it fully up to date.

## Windows Insider Program on HoloLens

By joining the Windows Insider Program from your HoloLens, you'll get access to preview builds of HoloLens software updates before they're available to the general public.

For information on how to participate in the Windows Insider Program on HoloLens, please refer to the [Insider preview for Microsoft HoloLens](https://docs.microsoft.com/hololens/hololens-insider) article in our IT Pro docs.
