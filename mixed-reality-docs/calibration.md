# Calibration

Calibrating your IPD (interpupillary distance) can improve the quality of your visuals. Both HoloLens and Windows Mixed Reality immersive headsets offer ways to customize IPD.

## HoloLens

### During setup

On HoloLens, you'll be prompted to calibrate your visuals during setup. This allows the device to adjust hologram display according to the user's [interpupillary distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpupillary_distance) (IPD). With an incorrect IPD, holograms may appear unstable or at an incorrect distance.

After Cortana introduces herself, the first setup step is calibration. It's recommended that you complete the calibration step during this setup phase, but it can be skipped by waiting until Cortana prompts you to say "Skip" to move on.

Users are asked to align their finger with a series of six targets per eye. Through this process, the HoloLens sets the correct IPD for the user. If the calibration needs to be updated or adjusted for a new user, it can be run outside of setup using the Calibration app.

### Calibration app

Calibration can be performed any time through the Calibration app. The Calibration app is installed by default and may be accessed from the Start menu, or through the Settings app. Calibration is recommended if you'd like to improve the quality of your visuals or calibrate visuals for a new user.

**Launching the app from Start**
1. Use [bloom](gestures.md#bloom) to get to [Start Menu](navigating-the-windows-mixed-reality-home.md#start-menu).
2. Select **+** to view all apps.
3. Launch **Calibration**.

**Launching the app from Settings**
1. Use [bloom](gestures.md#bloom) to get to [Start Menu](navigating-the-windows-mixed-reality-home.md#start-menu).
2. Select **+** to view all apps if **Settings** isn't pinned to Start.
3. Launch **Settings**.
4. Navigate to **System** > **Utilities** and select **Open Calibration**.

## Immersive headsets

To change IPD within your headset, open the Settings app and navigate to **Mixed reality** > **Headset display** and move the slider control. You’ll see the changes in real time in your headset. If you know your IPD, maybe from a visit to the optometrist, you can enter it directly as well.

You can also adjust this setting by going to **Settings** > **Mixed reality** > **Headset display** on your PC.

If your headset does not support IPD customization, this setting will be disabled.
