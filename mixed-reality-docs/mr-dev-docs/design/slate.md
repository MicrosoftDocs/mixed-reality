# Slate

![Slate](images/UX_Hero_Slate.jpg)

A slate is a thin window style control for displaying 2D content like plain text, images, or documents. A slate offers a grabbable title bar with buttons for 'Follow me (tag-along)' and close functionality. The content within a slate can be scrolled via [direct manipulation](direct-manipulation.md#2d-slate-interaction) just like a physical touch screen. You can use gaze, air-tap, and drag gesture or a motion controller's pointer as well.
