# Near menu

![Near menu](images/UX_Hero_NearMenu.jpg)

A near menu is a collection of buttons on a panel that follow your users with [tag-along behavior](billboarding-and-tag-along.md#what-is-a-tag-along). The panel stays within a set distance range and angle, which lets users comfortably interact with content. If you need to world-lock or disable the panel's tag-along behavior, use the pin button or grab and place the menu. Pinning the panel lets your users focus on the target content without any distractions. You can re-enable the tag-along behavior at any time by pressing the pin button to make the menu follow the user again.
