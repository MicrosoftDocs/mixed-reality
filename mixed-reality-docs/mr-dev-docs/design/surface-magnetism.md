# Surface magnetism

Surface magnetism lets you place holographic objects on real-world physical surfaces. By aligning the object's orientation with the real-world surface, you can create a more immersive and natural experience for the user.

## Surface magnetism in MRTK (Mixed Reality Toolkit) for Unity

**[MRTK](https://github.com/Microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity)** provides scripts and example scenes for the surface magnetism technique. You can use surface magnetism with various types of inputs such as hand-ray, eye gaze, and motion controllers.

* [MRTK - Surface magnetism solver](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/mixed-reality/mrtk-unity/features/ux-building-blocks/solvers/solver#surfacemagnetism)
