# Mixed Reality Learn overview

Microsoft Learn is where everyone comes to learn. Discover new skills, find certifications, and advance your career in minutes with interactive, hands-on learning paths. 

The more tools you have when developing for Mixed Reality the better. While documentation and written tutorials are crucial, if you're more of a visual learner then our video content on Microsoft Learn is the place to be. More modules are being added all the time, so be sure to check back for more updates!

Our Learn modules help you become proficient in Mixed Reality development, offering a module-based structure to get you started with key tools like Mixed Reality Toolkit, Unity, and Azure mixed reality services. Getting to Hello World has never been clearer, as we lay out the Learning Objectives, Prerequisites, and set time to completion expectations all in one interface.

## General modules

If you're curious about the foundations of Mixed Reality or haven't chosen a development path yet, start with our tech-agnostic learning modules to get started.

### [Introduction to Mixed Reality](/learn/modules/intro-to-mixed-reality/)

Build a foundation in the core concepts, terminology, and design processes unique to the Mixed Reality development space.

**Learning objectives**

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

* Define Mixed Reality and differentiate between virtual and augmented reality
* Describe the core ideas behind holograms
* Start designing and developing 3D applications
* Understand what Mixed Reality offers in real-world apps
* Use the power of the cloud for Mixed Reality

## Unity modules

Whether you're just starting or an experienced professional, our hands-on approach to Mixed Reality development in Unity helps you get to your goals faster, with more confidence, and at your own pace.

### [Build mixed reality digital twins with Azure Digital Twins and Unity](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/build-mixed-reality-azure-digital-twins-unity/)
