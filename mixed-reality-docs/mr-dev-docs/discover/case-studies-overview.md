        Working with holograms can be tricky. The fact that you can move around your space and see your holograms from all different angles provides a level of immersion that you can’t get with a normal computer screen.<br>

## Galaxy Explorer

Before Microsoft HoloLens shipped, we asked our developer community what kind of app they'd like to see an experienced internal team build for the new device. More than 5000 ideas were shared, and after a 24-hour Twitter poll, the winner was an idea called Galaxy Explorer.

        Welcome to the journey of how we're updating Galaxy Explorer for HoloLens 2. Galaxy Explorer was originally developed as an open-source application for HoloLens (1st gen) through the Share Your Idea program, and is one of the first mixed reality experiences many people had. Now we're updating it for the new capabilities of HoloLens 2.<br>

## HoloTour

HoloTour for Microsoft HoloLens provides immersive 3D personal tours of iconic locations around the world. As the designers, artists, producers, audio designers, and developers working on this project found out, creating a convincingly real 3D rendering of a well-known location takes a unique blend of creative and technological wizardry.

## RoboRaid

In this mixed reality first-person shooter, use gaze and gesture to target enemies, and dodge incoming fire using natural movements. Spatial mapping turns each room into a unique game level, while spatial sound lets you use the entire room to play—even the spaces behind you.

        **[Using spatial sound in RoboRaid](../design/case-study-using-spatial-sound-in-roboraid.md)**<br>
        Spatial sound is one of the most exciting features of Microsoft HoloLens, providing a way for users to perceive what's going on around them when objects are out of the line of sight.<br>

## Design and human experience

Read our high-level thoughts, and understand the principles we follow.
