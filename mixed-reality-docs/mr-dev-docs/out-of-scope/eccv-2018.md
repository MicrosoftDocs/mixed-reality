# HoloLens as a tool for computer vision research
0900 - 1230 September 8th, 2018

[ECCV 2018 Conference](https://eccv2018.org)

## Organizers
* Marc Pollefeys
* Shivkumar Swaminathan
* Johannes Schoenberger
* Andrew Fitzgibbon

## Overview
Microsoft HoloLens is the world’s first self-contained, holographic computer, but it’s also a potent computer vision research device.
Application code can access audio and video streams and surface meshes, all in a world coordinate space maintained by HoloLens’
highly accurate head-tracking. This tutorial will dive into the new “Research Mode” capability of HoloLens.
We will show you how to access the raw head-tracking and depth sensor data streams, and make use of the intrinsics and
extrinsics of each stream.  We will also be demonstrating recent advances in time of flight depth-sensing technologies in the Kinect for Azure project.

## Schedule
* 0900 – Introduction
* 0930 – HoloLens Research Mode
* 1030 – Coffee break
* 1100 – Applications & Demos
* 1130 – Kinect for Azure Depth Sensor
* 1200 – Q & A
* 1230 – Tutorial ends

Attendees to this tutorial will leave with a good sense of how HoloLens can be used for a range of Computer Vision research tasks, and materials to quickly get them started using the device.
