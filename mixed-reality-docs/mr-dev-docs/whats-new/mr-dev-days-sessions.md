|[Opening Keynote](https://aka.ms/MRDDKeynote)|Alex Kipman|Alex Kipman starts our first ever virtual Mixed Reality Dev Days event.|
|[Intro to Azure Mixed Reality Services: Azure Remote Rendering](/shows/Mixed-Reality/Intro-to-Azure-Mixed-Reality-Services-Azure-Remote-Rendering)|Jonathan Lyons, Christopher Manthei, and Marc Appelsmeier|Azure Remote Rendering just entered public preview.  Learn how ARR renders and streams interactive 3D models with hundreds of millions of polygons to devices like HoloLens 2 in real time.|
|[Intro to Unreal + MRTK for HoloLens 2](/shows/Mixed-Reality/Intro-to-Unreal--MRTK-for-HoloLens-2)|Summer Wu & Luis Valverde|Unreal Engine support for HoloLens 2 reached production-ready status with the release of UE 4.25 in May! Alongside UE 4.25, in response to the top ask we've been hearing from developers since Unreal's HoloLens support first shipped in preview, our team released the first component of the Mixed Reality Toolkit for Unreal: UX Tools 0.8. In this talk, we'll provide an overview of the features provided in Unreal Engine 4 and MRTK for Unreal, and how to use them to build epic experiences for HoloLens 2.|
|[Getting started with the HoloLens 2 and Unity](/shows/Mixed-Reality/Getting-started-with-the-HoloLens-2-and-Unity)|Dan Miller - Unity|Learn the basics of setting up Unity and building for the HoloLens 2. This presentation will cover best practices, basic features of the HoloLens 2 and how to quickly add hand tracking support and interactivity with native Unity APIs|
|[Intro to Azure Mixed Reality Services: Azure Spatial Anchors](/shows/Mixed-Reality/Intro-to-Azure-Mixed-Reality-Services-Azure-Spatial-Anchors)|Archana Iyer & Vicente Rivera|An overview of Azure Spatial Anchors (ASA) and relevant scenarios. This talk will go over new capabilities developed in the past year, with code samples on how to use them. We'll go over best practices while building with ASA and how you can start integrating it into your products.|
|[Intro to MRTK-Unity](/shows/Mixed-Reality/Intro-to-MRTK-Unity)|Catherine Diaz|The Introduction to MRTK session will be a tutorial on how to create an MRTK app from start to finish.  This talk will go over interaction concepts and show MRTK’s multi-platform capabilities.|
|[Learnings from the MR Surfaces App](/shows/Mixed-Reality/Learnings-from-the-MR-Surfaces-App)|Lars Simkins|Join the engineers behind the MRDL Surfaces app for HoloLens 2 as they talk about the app’s design story and technical highlights.|
|[Azure Kinect Body Tracking Unity Integration](/shows/Mixed-Reality/Azure-Kinect-Body-Tracking-Unity-Integration)|Angus Antley| Learn how to drive characters in Unity using the Azure Kinect Body Tracking SDK.|
|[MRTK’s UX Building Blocks](/shows/Mixed-Reality/MRTKs-UX-Building-Blocks)|Yoon Park|Deep dive on the MRTK’s UX components that help you build beautiful mixed reality experiences.|
|[MRTK Performance Tools](/shows/Mixed-Reality/MRTK-Performance-and-Shaders)|Kurtis Eveleigh & David Kline|An introduction to performance tools, both in MRTK and external, and an overview of the MRTK Standard Shader.|
|[The State of Mixed Reality--Where Companies are finding Success](/shows/Mixed-Reality/The-State-of-Mixed-Reality-Where-Companies-are-finding-Success)|Ori Amiga & Matt Fleckenstein|Ultra-low latency edge computing, coupled with AI and mixed reality, is the foundation for the next generation of experiences. By blending the digital and the physical worlds into ubiquitous computing experiences, mixed reality is enabling possibilities we could have only dreamed of previously. In this session, Ori and Matt will provide unique insight into the mixed reality market opportunity today and in the future. They'll highlight how Microsoft is helping leading enterprises in manufacturing, health care and retail harness the power of mixed reality to drive business efficiency and transform customer and employee experiences.|
|[Fireside Chat](https://aka.ms/MRDDFireside)|Alex Kipman & René Schulte|Opening up day two we have invited Microsoft MVP, Regional Director, and community member extraordinaire René Schulte to stand around a fire and chat about the topics the community is interested in. René has been gathering questions from the community for about a week, and we anticipate it's going to be a great conversation.|
|[Designing AR/VR experiences using Microsoft Maquette](/shows/Mixed-Reality/Designing-ARVR-experiences-using-Microsoft-Maquette)|Ricardo Acosta|Designing a phone app or a website has a well-defined workflow. Unfortunately, due to its novelty designing spatial reality experiences can be tricky if you use the same 2D workflow or toolset. Luckily, the new Microsoft Maquette app focuses on helping UX designers to design.|
|[MRTK Unity v2 & beyond - How community feedback helped us improve MRTK](/shows/Mixed-Reality/MRTK-Unity-v2-and-beyond-How-community-feedback-helped-us-improve-MRTK)|Bernadette Thalhammer|A talk about how we've improved the developer experience over the last year by listening to feedback from the community and how developers can leverage these improvements. We'll dive into the documentation and unit testing, the new object manipulator component, using the migration window and will explore some code snippets around our most frequently asked questions from the dev community.|
|[Dark Slope's Unreal Engine plugin for the Azure Kinect DK](/shows/Mixed-Reality/Dark-Slopes-Unreal-Engine-plugin-for-the-Azure-Kinect-DK)|Ben Unsworth - Dark Slope|Learn how Dark Slope is using the Azure Kinect DK and its SDKs to build real-time interactive engagements in Unreal Engine.|
|[Introducing StereoKit - MR Made Easy!](/shows/Mixed-Reality/Introducing-StereoKit-MR-Made-Easy)|Nick Klingensmith|StereoKit is an easy-to-use open-source mixed reality library for building HoloLens and VR applications with C# and OpenXR! StereoKit prioritizes mixed reality application development above all else, allowing for features such as a first-class mixed reality input system, fast performance by default even on mobile devices, quick iteration time on-device, and a runtime asset pipeline that lets users and developers load real assets from the file-system. All of this and more are packaged in a terse API that’s well documented, easy to learn, and easy to write!|
