# 6. Creating user interfaces

In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a simple user interface using MRTK's button and menu prefabs alongside Unity's TextMeshPro component. You will also learn how to configure the buttons to trigger events and add dynamic tooltip UI elements to provide the user with additional information.

## Objectives

* Learn how to organize buttons in a collection
* Learn how to use MRTK's menu prefabs
* Learn how to interact with holograms using UI menus and buttons
* Learn how to add text elements
* Learn how to spawn tooltips on objects dynamically

## Creating a static panel of buttons

In the Hierarchy window, right-click on the **RoverExplorer** object and select **Create Empty** to add an empty object as a child of the RoverExplorer, name the object **Buttons**, and configure the **Transform** component as follows:

* **Position**: X = -0.6, Y = 0.036, Z = -0.5
* **Rotation**: X = 90, Y = 0, Z = 0
* **Scale**: X = 1, Y = 1, Z = 1

In the Hierarchy window, select the **Buttons** object, then in the Inspector window, use the **Add Component** button to add the **GridObjectCollection** component and configure it as follows:

* **Sort Type**: Child Order
* **Layout**: Horizontal
* **Cell Width**: 0.2
* **Anchor**: Middle Left

Then click the **Update Collection** button to update the position of the Buttons object's child objects:

In the Hierarchy window, name the buttons **Hints**, **Explode**, and **Reset**.

For each button, select the **SeeItSayItLabel** > **TextMeshPro** child object, then in the Inspector window, change the respective **TextMeshPro - Text** component text to match the button names:

![Unity with button text labels configured](images/mr-learning-base/base-06-section1-step1-4.png)

Once done, collapse the Buttons object's child objects.

In the Hierarchy window, select the **Hints** button object, then in the Inspector window, configure the **Interactable.OnClick ()** event as follows:

* Assign the **RoverAssembly** object to the **None (Object)** field
* From the **No Function** dropdown, select **PlacementHintsController** > **TogglePlacementHints ()** to set this function as the action to be executed when the event is triggered

![Unity with Hints button object OnClick event configured](images/mr-learning-base/base-06-section1-step1-5.png)

> [!TIP]
> The Interactable component is an all-in-one container to make any object easily interactable and responsive to input. Interactable acts as a catch-all for all types of input including touch, hand rays, speech, etc. and funnels these interactions into events and visual theme responses. To learn how to configure it for different input types and customize it's visual theme, you can refer to the [Interactable](https://microsoft.github.io/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/Documentation/README_Interactable.html) guide in the [MRTK Documentation Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/mixed-reality/mrtk-unity/).

In the Hierarchy window, select the **Explode** button object, then in the Inspector window, configure the **Interactable.OnClick ()** event as follows:

* Assign the **RoverAssembly** object to the **None (Object)** field
* From the **No Function** dropdown, select **ExplodedViewController** > **ToggleExplodedView ()** to set this function as the action to be executed when the event is triggered

![Unity with Explode button object OnClick event configured](images/mr-learning-base/base-06-section1-step1-6.png)

Press the Play button to enter Game mode, then press-and-hold the space bar button to activate the hand and use the mouse to press the **Hints** button to toggle the visibility of the placement hint objects:

## Creating a dynamic menu that follows the user

In the Project window, navigate to the **Packages** > **Mixed Reality Toolkit Foundation** > **SDK** > **Features** > **UX** > **Prefabs** > **Menus** folder, click-and-drag the **NearMenu4x1** prefab into the Hierarchy window, set its Transform **Position** to X = 0, Y = -0.4, Z = 0 and configure it as follows:

* Verify that the **SolverHandler** component's **Tracked Target Type** is set to **Head**
* Check the checkbox next to the **RadialView** Solver component so it is enabled by default

![Unity with newly added near menu prefab selected](images/mr-learning-base/base-06-section2-step1-1.png)

In the Hierarchy window, rename the object to **Menu**, then expand its **ButtonCollection** child object to reveal the four buttons:

![Unity with Menu object selected and ButtonCollection object expanded](images/mr-learning-base/base-06-section2-step1-2.png)

Rename the first button in the ButtonCollection to Indicator, then in the Inspector window, configure the Button Config Helper (Script) component as follows:

* Change the **Main Label Text** to match the name of the button
* Assign the Indicator object that looks like a chevron, to the None (Object) field
* From the **No Function** dropdown, select **GameObject** > **SetActive (bool)** to set this function as the action to be executed when the event is triggered
* Verify that the argument checkbox is **checked**
* Change the **Icon** to the 'search' icon

![Unity with Indicator button object Button Config Helper configured](images/mr-learning-base/base-06-section2-step1-3.png)

To disable the chevron Indicator object, in the Hierarchy window, select the Indicator object that looks like chevron, then in the Inspector window:

* Uncheck the checkbox next to its name to make it inactive by default
* Use the **Add Component** button to add the **Directional Indicator Controller (Script)** component

![Unity with Indicator object selected, disabled, and DirectionalIndicatorController component added](images/mr-learning-base/base-06-section2-step1-4.png)

> [!NOTE]
> Now, when the app starts, the chevron Indicator is disabled by default and can be enabled by pressing the Indicator button.

Rename the second button to **TapToPlace**, then in the Inspector window, configure the **Button Config Helper (Script)** component as follows:

* Change the **Main Label Text** to match the name of the button
* Assign the RoverExplorer > **RoverAssembly** object to the **None (Object)** field
* From the **No Function** dropdown, select **TapToPlace** > **bool Enabled** to update this property value when the event is triggered
* Verify that the argument checkbox is **checked**
* Change the **Icon** to the 'hand with ray' icon

![Unity with TapToPlace button object Button Config Helper configured](images/mr-learning-base/base-06-section2-step1-5.png)

In the Hierarchy window, select the **RoverAssembly** object, then in the Inspector window, configure the **Tap To Place (Script)** component as follows:

* Uncheck the checkbox next to its name to make it inactive by default
* In the **On Placing Stopped ()** event section, click the **+** icon to add a new event:
* Assign the RoverExplorer > **RoverAssembly** object to the **None (Object)** field
* From the **No Function** dropdown, select **TapToPlace** > **bool Enabled** to update this property value when the event is triggered
* Verify that the argument checkbox is **unchecked**

![Unity with TapToPlace component reconfigured](images/mr-learning-base/base-06-section2-step1-6.png)

> [!NOTE]
> Now, when the app starts, the Tap to Place functionality is disabled by default and can be enabled by pressing the Tap to Place button. Additionally, when the tap to place is completed, it will disable itself.

## Adding text to the scene

In the Hierarchy window, right-click on the **Table** object and select **3D Object** > **Text - TextMeshPro** to add a text object as a child of the Table object, then in the Inspector window, configure the **Rect Transform** component as follows:

* Change **Pos Y** to 1
* Change **Width** to 1
* Change **Height** to 1
* Change **Rotation X** to 90

![Unity with newly created TextMeshPro object selected](images/mr-learning-base/base-06-section3-step1-1.png)

Then configure the **TextMeshPro - Text** component as follows::

* Change **Text** to Rover Explorer
* Change **Font Style** to Bold
* Change **Font Size** to 1
* Change Extra Settings > **Margins** to 0.03

## Adding tooltips

In the Project window, navigate to the **Packages** > **Mixed Reality Toolkit Foundation** > **SDK** > **Features** > **UX** > **Prefabs** > **ToolTip** folder to locate the tooltip prefabs:

![Unity Project window with ToolTips folder selected](images/mr-learning-base/base-06-section4-step1-1.png)

In the Hierarchy window, expand the RoverExplorer > **RoverParts** object and select all its child rover part objects, then in the Inspector window, use the **Add Component** button to add the **ToolTipSpawner** component and configure it as follows:

* Ensure the **Focus Enabled** checkbox is checked to require the user to look at the part for the tooltip to appear
* Assign the **Simple Line ToolTip** prefab from the Project window to the **Prefab** field
* Change the ToolTip Override Settings > **Settings Mode** to **Override**
* Change the ToolTip Override Settings > **Manual Pivot Local Position Y** to **1.5**

![Unity with all rover part objects selected and ToolTipSpawner component added and configured](images/mr-learning-base/base-06-section4-step1-2.png)

In the Hierarchy window, select the first rover part, RoverParts > **Camera_Part**, and configure the **ToolTipSpawner** component as follows:

* Change **Tool Tip Text** to reflect the name of the part, i.e., **Camera**

![Unity with Camera ToolTipText configured](images/mr-learning-base/base-06-section4-step1-3.png)

**Repeat** this step for each of the rover part objects to configure the **ToolTipSpawner** component as follows:

* For the **Generator_Part**, change the **Tool Tip Text** to **Generator**
* For the **Lights_Part**, change the **Tool Tip Text** to **Lights**
* For the **UHFAntenna_Part**, change the **Tool Tip Text** to **UHF Antenna** field
* For the **Spectrometer_Part**, change the **Tool Tip Text** to **Spectrometer**

Press the Play button to enter Game mode, then press-and-hold the right mouse button while moving your mouse until the gaze hit's one of the parts and the tooltip for that part will be displayed:
