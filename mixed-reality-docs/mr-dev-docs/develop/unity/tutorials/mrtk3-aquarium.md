# MRTK3 Aquarium

:::image type="content" source="images/iet-banner.png" alt-text="MRTK3 Aquarium scene.":::

The MRTK3 Aquarium sample provides a Unity in-editor tutorial that explores various MRTK3 features. Set in an underwater scene, you'll be introduced to the creatures of the aquarium and the objects that make up their habitat. Using MRTK3 features, you'll add interactivity to the aquarium which will enable you to create an aquarium of your very own!

In this sample, you'll learn how to do the following:
- Preview scenes without the need to compile and deploy the project
- Simulate input directly into the Unity editor with MRTK In-Editor Input Simulation
- Move and manipulate the objects in the aquarium
- Add a bounding box around aquarium objects and maniuplate the object using handles
- Create a canvas button to toggle an object's visibility
- Create a canvas button bar configured to spawn objects into the aquarium

## Prerequisites

- A Windows 10 or 11 PC
- Visual Studio 2022 with the required workloads (as noted in the [Installation Checklist](/windows/mixed-reality/develop/install-the-tools))
- Windows 10 SDK 10.0.18362.0 or later
- Unity Hub with Unity 2021.3.4f1 LTS installed
