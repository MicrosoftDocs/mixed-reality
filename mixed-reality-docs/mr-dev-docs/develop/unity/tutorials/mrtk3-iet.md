The MRTK3 Aquarium sample provides a Unity in-editor tutorial that explores various MRTK3 features. Set in an underwater scene, you'll be introduced to the creatures of the aquarium and the objects which make up their habit.

- Manipulate and arrange objects in the aquarium
- Add bounding boxes to objects in the aquarium
- Create buttons to spawn objects in the aquarium
- Create dynamic UI to organize scene controls
- Add a confirmation dialog to confirm actions
- Configure theming options to change the look of the scene UI controls
