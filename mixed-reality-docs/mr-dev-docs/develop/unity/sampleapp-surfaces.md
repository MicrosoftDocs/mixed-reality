# Surfaces

![Surfaces](images/MRDL_Surfaces_1.jpg)

>[!NOTE]
>This article discusses an exploratory sample we’ve created in the [Mixed Reality Design Labs](https://github.com/Microsoft/MRDesignLabs_Unity), a place where we share our learnings about and suggestions for mixed reality app development. Our design-related articles and code will evolve as we make new discoveries.

[Surfaces](https://github.com/microsoft/MRDL_Unity_Surfaces)  is an open-source sample app from Microsoft's Mixed Reality Design Labs. It explores how we can create a tactile sensation with visual, audio, and fully articulated hand-tracking.

## Download app from Microsoft Store in HoloLens 2
If you have HoloLens 2 device, you can directly download and install the app in your device.

## About the app

Surfaces demonstrates how to use Mixed Reality Toolkit(MRTK)'s input system and building blocks to create an app experience for HoloLens 2. In this project, you can find the examples of:

- Use MRTK's [Input System](/windows/mixed-reality/mrtk-unity/features/input/overview), specifically hand / joint tracking.
- Use MRTK's [Standard Shader](/windows/mixed-reality/mrtk-unity/features/rendering/mrtk-standard-shader) for performant graphics.

You can use this project's components to create your own mixed reality app experiences.
