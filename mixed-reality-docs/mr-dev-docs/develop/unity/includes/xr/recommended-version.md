<!-- UNCOMMENT THE FOLLOWING WHEN THE CURRENT UNITY VERSION HAS NO BLOCKING ISSUE: -->

We recommend to use **the latest patch version of Unity 2020.3 LTS or 2021.3 LTS** and their recommended version of Unity plugins, together with **the latest Mixed Reality OpenXR plugin**.
 
If using an earlier Unity patch release, be sure to consult the [known blocking issues table](../../known-issues.md#active-blocking-issues) to ensure you avoid builds with other blocking issues.
