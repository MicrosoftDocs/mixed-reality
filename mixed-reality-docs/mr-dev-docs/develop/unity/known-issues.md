# Known issues in Unity versions and packages

Some versions of Unity or Unity plugins have known incompatibilities blocking apps from working as expected on HoloLens 2 or Windows Mixed Reality devices. While we generally support all LTS versions of Unity and their verified plugins, we recommend avoiding those specific builds of Unity and Unity plugins to ensure your apps work as expected.

| Blocking&nbsp;issues | Status&nbsp;&&nbsp;Last&nbsp;Update | &nbsp;&nbsp;Versions&nbsp;with&nbsp;issue&nbsp;&nbsp; | &nbsp;&nbsp;Mitigation&nbsp;&nbsp; |
| :----------- | :----- | :--------------: | :--------------: |
| HL2 app using URP has worse render performance in Unity 2022 compared to Unity 2021 when using the default URP Lit material. | **Investigating:**<br />2023/01/04 | Unity 2022.\*.\* <br/> with URP 13.\*.\* | Either avoid URP in Unity 2022, avoid using the default URP materials or use URP in Unity 2021.3.14+ |
| Unable to build UWP app packages (APPX or MSIX) in Unity 2021 and 2022 | **In Progress:**<br />2023/09/29 | Reproducible with: 2021.3.30f1, 2022.3.8f1 | Use Unity 2021.3.27 or earlier. Or manually add Appx Manifest to the app's VS project. See [Unity's forum](https://forum.unity.com/threads/unity-version-2021-3-28f1-lacks-the-uwp-publish-button-in-visual-studio-build-for-package-generation.1480761/) and [Unity's Issue Tracker](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/create-app-packages-dot-dot-dot-option-is-greyed-out-when-trying-to-create-app-packages-in-visual-studio) for more details. |
| An HL2 app importing both MRTK3 and Azure Spatial Anchors may present 'Guid for asset conflicts with' errors when the ARFoundation package version doesn't match the imported ARSubsystems version.|||When using ARFoundation 5.x+, manually add com.unity.xr.arsubsystems version 5.0.2 to the project's Package Manager. You'll get a warning that ARSubsystems has been deprecated, but it can be ignored. |
