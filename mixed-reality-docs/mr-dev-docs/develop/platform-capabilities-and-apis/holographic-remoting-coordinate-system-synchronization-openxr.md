# Coordinate System Synchronization with Holographic Remoting and the OpenXR API

With the OpenXR API the user coordinate system is wrapped into a reference space of type ```XR_REMOTING_REFERENCE_SPACE_TYPE_USER_MSFT```.

>[!TIP]
>A simple example can be found in the remote and player samples inside the [Holographic Remoting samples github repository](https://github.com/microsoft/MixedReality-HolographicRemoting-Samples).
>Uncomment ```#define ENABLE_USER_COORDINATE_SYSTEM_SAMPLE``` inside the OpenXrProgramm.cpp and SamplePlayerMain.h files to enable the sample code.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>To learn about the Holographic Remoting OpenXR extension API, check out the [specification](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/microsoft/MixedReality-HolographicRemoting-Samples/blob/main/remote_openxr/specification.html) which can be found in the [Holographic Remoting samples github repository](https://github.com/microsoft/MixedReality-HolographicRemoting-Samples).

## Get the User Coordinate System in the Remote App

To create the user coordinate system in the remote app call ```xrCreateReferenceSpace``` with the ```XR_REMOTING_REFERENCE_SPACE_TYPE_USER_MSFT``` argument.
