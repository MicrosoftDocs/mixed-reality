The Windows Device Portal for HoloLens lets you configure and manage your device remotely over Wi-Fi or USB. The Device Portal is a web server on your HoloLens that you can connect to from a web browser on your PC. The Device Portal includes many tools that will help you manage your HoloLens and debug and optimize your apps.

This documentation is specifically about the Windows Device Portal for HoloLens. To use the Windows Device portal for desktop (including for Windows Mixed Reality), see [Windows Device Portal overview](/windows/uwp/debug-test-perf/device-portal)

> [NOTE!]
> Using device portal is not recommended to be used for HoloLens devices you are deploying to your organization.

## Setting up HoloLens to use Windows Device Portal

1. Power on your HoloLens and put on the device.
2. Use the [Start gesture](/hololens/hololens2-basic-usage#start-gesture) for HoloLens2 or [Bloom](/hololens/hololens1-basic-usage#open-the-start-menu-with-bloom) on HoloLens (1st Gen) to launch the main menu. 
3. Gaze at the **Settings** tile and do an [air-tap](/hololens/hololens1-basic-usage#select-holograms-with-gaze-and-air-tap) gesture on HoloLens (1st Gen). You can also select it on HoloLens 2 by [touching it or using a Hand ray](/hololens/hololens2-basic-usage). 
4. Select the **Update** menu item.
5. Select the **For developers** menu item.
6. Enable **Developer Mode**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you're in multi-user and not an admin, the ability to enter Developer Mode may be grayed out. Please ensure that you are an **[admin on the device](/hololens/security-adminless-os)**.

7. [Scroll down](../../design/gaze-and-commit.md#composite-gestures) and enable **Device Portal**.
8. If you're setting up Windows Device Portal so you can deploy apps to this HoloLens over USB or Wi-Fi, select **Pair** to [generate a pairing PIN](using-visual-studio.md). Leave the Settings app at the PIN popup until you enter the PIN into Visual Studio during your first deployment.

![Enabling developer mode in the Settings app for Windows Holographic](images/using-windows-portal-img-01.jpg)

## Connecting over Wi-Fi

1. [Connect your HoloLens to Wi-Fi](/hololens/hololens-network).
2. Look up your device's IP address by either:
  * Going to **Settings > Network & Internet > Wi-Fi > Advanced Options**.
  * Going to **Settings > Network & Internet** and selecting **Hardware properties**.
  * Using the "What's my IP address?" voice command.

![HoloLens 2 settings](images/using-windows-portal-img-02.jpg)

3. From a web browser on your PC, go to https://<YOUR_HOLOLENS_IP_ADDRESS>
   * The browser will display the following message: "There's a problem with this website's security certificate" because the certificate, which is issued to the Device Portal is a test certificate. You can ignore this certificate error for now and continue.

## Connecting over USB

> [!IMPORTANT]
> IpOverUsb is no longer recommended per new browser standards as it requires the use of port 10080. If you still wish to use IpOverUsb, check the 'USB Device Connectivity' box during Visual Studio installation, which isn't checked by default. Instead, we recommend connecting with UsbNcm, which is supported by default on HoloLens 2. If you are using a HoloLens 1, we recommend connecting to your PC using WiFi.

1. If your HoloLens 2 is running Windows Holographic version 21H1 or higher, go to 'For developers' in the Settings app and make sure that 'Device discovery' is toggled ON. 
2. Connect your HoloLens 2 to your PC with a USB-C cable.
3. Find your UsbNcm IP. There are a few ways to do this:
  * In the Settings app on the device (This method only works for HoloLenses running Windows Holographic version 21H1 or higher, with 'Device discovery' toggled ON.)
    1. Go into the Settings app on the device.
    2. Go to "Update & Security" > "For developers." This is the same place you enabled Device Portal.
    3. At the bottom of the page, copy your **Ethernet** IP address. This is your UsbNcm IP. 
    ![HoloLens 2 settings - UsbNcm IP](images/deviceportal_usbncm_ipaddress.jpg)

  * In Device Portal 
    1. On your device, open Device Portal using your HoloLens' WiFi address. If you don't know your HoloLens' WiFi address, you can use the voice command "What's my IP address?"
    2. Go to System > Networking
    3. On the far right side of the page in the "IP Configuration" panel, locate the section that starts with "Description: UsbNcm Function."
    4. Your UsbNcm IP is the "IPv4 address" line. You can copy the address or just click on the address - it is a hyperlink which will reopen Device Portal using the UsbNcm IP.
  
  * In a command prompt
    1. In any command prompt, navigate to the bin\<SDK version>\x86 folder where your Windows 10 SDK is installed, such as C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\bin\10.0.19041.0\x86.
    2. Type "winappdeploycmd devices" and press Enter.
    3. In the output, look for the entry where the Model/Name column is your HoloLens device name, such as HOLOLENS-xxxxxx. The UsbNcm IP is at the start of this line and will be an Automatic Private IP address in the form of 169.254.x.x. Copy this address. 
 
4. If you copied your UsbNcm IP, from a web browser on your PC go to https:// followed by your UsbNcm IP.

### Moving files over USB

You can move files from your PC to your HoloLens without any additional setup.
1. Connect your PC to your HoloLens with a USB cord
2. Drag your files into **PC\\[Your_HoloLens_Device_Name]\Internal Storage** on your desktop
3. Open the **Start Menu** and select **All apps > File Explorer** on your HoloLens

> [!NOTE]
> You may need to select **This device** on the left side of the panel to navigate away from "Recently used" to locate your files. 

## Connecting to an emulator

You can also use the Device Portal with your emulator. To connect to the Device Portal, use the [toolbar](using-the-hololens-emulator.md). Select this icon:
![Open Device Portal icon](images/emulator-deviceportal.png) **Open Device Portal**: Open the Windows Device Portal for the HoloLens OS in the emulator.

## Creating a Username and Password

![Set up access to Windows Device Portal](images/windows-device-portal-credentials-reset-page-1000px.png)<br>
*Set up access to Windows Device Portal*

The first time you connect to the Device Portal on your HoloLens, you'll need to create a username and password.
1. In a web browser on your PC, enter the IP address of the HoloLens. The Setup access page opens.
2. Select or tap **Request pin** and look at the HoloLens display to get the generated PIN.
3. Enter the PIN in the **PIN displayed on your device** textbox.
4. Enter the user name you'll use to connect to the Device Portal. It doesn't need to be a Microsoft Account (MSA) name or a domain name.
5. Enter a password and confirm it. The password must be at least seven characters in length. It doesn't need to be an MSA or domain password.
6. Click **Pair** to connect to Windows Device Portal on the HoloLens.

If you wish to change this username or password at any time, you can repeat this process by visiting the device security page by  navigating to: https://<YOUR_HOLOLENS_IP_ADDRESS>/devicepair.htm.

## Security certificate

If you see a "certificate error" in your browser, you can fix it by creating a trust relationship with the device.

Each HoloLens generates a self-signed certificate for its SSL connection. By default, this certificate is not trusted by your PC's web browser and you may get a "certificate error". You can securely connect to your device by downloading this certificate from your HoloLens over USB or a Wi-Fi network you trust and trusting it on your PC.
1. **Make sure you are on a secure network (USB or a Wi-Fi network you trust).**
2. Download this device's certificate from the "Security" page on the Device Portal.
   * Navigate to: https://<YOUR_HOLOLENS_IP_ADDRESS>/devicepair.htm
   * Open the node for System > Preferences. 
   * Scroll down to Device Security, select the "Download this device's certificate" button.
3. Install the certificate in the "Trusted Root Certification Authorities" store on your PC.
   * From the Windows menu, type: Manage Computer Certificates and start the applet.
   * Expand the **Trusted Root Certification Authority** folder.
   * Select the **Certificates** folder.
   * From the Action menu, select: All Tasks > Import...
   * Complete the Certificate Import Wizard, using the certificate file you downloaded from the Device Portal.
4. Restart the browser.

>[!NOTE]
> This certificate will only be trusted for the device and the user will have to go through the process again if the device is flashed.
