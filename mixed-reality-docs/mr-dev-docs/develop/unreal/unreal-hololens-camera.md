# HoloLens Photo/Video Camera in Unreal

The HoloLens has a Photo/Video (PV) Camera on the visor that can be used for both Mixed Reality Capture (MRC) and locating objects in Unreal world space from pixel coordinates in the camera frame.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The PV Camera isn't supported with Holographic Remoting, but it's possible to use a webcam attached to your PC to simulate the HoloLens PV Camera functionality.

## Next Development Checkpoint

If you're following the Unreal development journey we've laid out, you're in the midst of exploring the Mixed Reality platform capabilities and APIs. From here, you can continue to the next topic:

> [QR codes](unreal-qr-codes.md)

Or jump directly to deploying your app on a device or emulator:

> [Deploying to device](unreal-deploying.md)

You can always go back to the [Unreal development checkpoints](unreal-development-overview.md#3-advanced-features) at any time.
