### February 25, 2019
As a workgroup, we want to keep things pretty casual, just show up around 6:00, hang out and work for a while! It's a great opportunity to get feedback from other developers, seek out help and advice from someone who's tried it before, or chill for a while after work and code! So bring a laptop, bring a project, and bring an open mind! The Microsoft Reactor is a roomy place, and we're keeping attendance limited so it's not a busy crowd. We hope to see you there!
