### What is the price point?

**Quick Answer:** Headset and controller pricing varies by manufacturer and retailer. See <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/collections/vrandmixedrealityheadsets> for Mixed Reality devices currently for sale from Microsoft.

### What is the difference between a Windows Mixed Reality PC and a Windows Mixed Reality Ultra PC?

**Quick Answer:** Details about Windows Mixed Reality PCs and Ultra PCs are captured here: <https://aka.ms/mrcompat>

### Why is this called Windows "Mixed Reality" when the devices look like they provide a "Virtual Reality" experience?

**Quick Answer:** Mixed Reality refers to the full spectrum of spatial computing, from augmented reality and holograms to virtual reality. Microsofts Mixed Reality platform supports both Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality. We currently support two device types with similar technology on that spectrum: HoloLens (AR) and Windows Mixed Reality (VR) headsets with motion controllers. 

Learn more about Mixed Reality here: <https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/mixed-reality/mixed-reality>

### What is the difference between Windows Mixed Reality and other VR headsets?

**Quick Answer:** Windows Mixed Reality headsets feature inside-out tracking (tracking cameras are in the headset) and plug-and-play setup with Windows 10.

**More detail**: Windows Mixed Reality offers several features, including easy setup (no need for external sensors to track you and your controllers), your choice of headsets to meet your comfort and price-point, headsets that have competitive resolutions, and finally a unique user experience that features a spatial interface which allows you to use thousands of apps from the Microsoft Store.

### Does Mixed Reality mean that inside-out cameras are passthrough? Can you experience Augmented Reality in addition to Virtual Reality?

**Quick Answer:** No, the inside-out cameras on Windows Mixed Reality headsets are used for positional tracking only. Windows Mixed Reality headsets are occluded, meaning that they are for Virtual Reality and do not provide a view of the real world or Augmented Reality. 

### What is inside-out tracking? How is it different than Outside-in tracking or Lighthouse tracking?

* **Inside-out Tracking** Windows Mixed Reality uses inside-out tracking. With Inside-out tracking cameras are built into the headset and track changes in the environement in order to determine the headsets position in relation to the environment as you move around. 

* **Outside-in Tracking** Oculus, Vive and others use Outside-in tracking.  With Outside-in tracking the headset is tracked by one or more external devices. Camera(s) are built into those external devices, placed around the environment and are used to determine the position of the headset in relation to the environment. 

To learn more about inside-out tracking you can go here: <https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/mixed-reality/enthusiast-guide/tracking-system>

### Can inside-out tracking of motion controllers impact my game play due to camera FOV?

**Quick Answer:** We recommend you visit a Microsoft store near you to try out the headset and controllers for yourself and get a feel for it. This page will help you find a Microsoft Store location near you: <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/locations/all-locations>

**Not so Quick Answer:** Like the headsets, the Windows Mixed Reality motion controllers require no setup of external tracking sensors. Instead, the controllers are tracked by sensors in the headset itself. If the user moves the controllers out of the headset's field of view, in most cases Windows will continue to infer controller positions and provide them to the app. When the controller has lost visual tracking for long enough, the controller's positions will drop to approximate-accuracy positions. At this point, the system will body-lock the controller to the user, tracking the user's position as they move around, while still exposing the controller's true orientation using its internal orientation sensors. Many apps that use controllers to point at and activate UI elements can operate normally while in approximate accuracy without the user even noticing. The best way to get a feel for this is to try it yourself. Try visiting a Microsoft store near you and check it out! In the meantime, here's a video with examples of immersive content that works with motion controllers across various tracking states: 

### How is Windows Mixed Reality different from Samsung Gear VR?

**Quick Answer:** All smartphone based VR products, including the Samsung Gear VR and Google Daydream, use 3 Degrees Of Freedom (3DOF) head position tracking systems. 3DOF based systems allow you to move your head **only** from the neck up in the virtual world. Windows MR on the other hand uses a 6 Degrees of Freedom (6DOF) head and controllers position tracking systems. 6DOF based systems allow you to move your entire body in the virtual world; so you can walk around an object and see it from different perspectives, just like you can in the physical world. The Rift and the Vive are also 6DOF based systems.
