# Before you start

## What you'll need to run Windows Mixed Reality

* A [Windows Mixed Reality head mounted display (HMD)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-mixed-reality-devices).
* A [Windows Mixed Reality compatible PC](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4039260/windows-10-mixed-reality-pc-hardware-guidelines) running Windows 10 Version 20H2 or later or Windows 11.
* A reliable internet connection.
* Display, USB, and Bluetooth adapters (if not pre-built into HMD or PC).
* Windows Mixed Reality motion controllers, an Xbox gamepad, or a mouse and keyboard.
* Headphones and microphone (if not pre-built into HMD or PC).
* A large, open space to support your virtual [room boundary](set-up-windows-mixed-reality.md#set-up-your-room-boundary).

## Make sure your PC is compatible with Windows Mixed Reality

Check the [Windows Mixed Reality minimum PC hardware compatibility guidelines](windows-mixed-reality-minimum-pc-hardware-compatibility-guidelines.md) or run the [Windows Mixed Reality Portal](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/mixed-reality-portal/9NG1H8B3ZC7M?hl=en-us&gl=US) app on your PC to check for Windows Mixed Reality compatibility.

Read up on [PC compatibility issues](get-help-with-pc-compatibility.md) for more details.

## Make sure you have Windows 10 Version 20H2 or newer installed

You must be running Windows 10 Version 20H2 or newer to use Windows Mixed Reality. Compatible versions of Windows include:

* Windows 10 Version 20H2
* Windows 10 Version 21H1
* Windows 10 Version 21H2
* Windows 11

To see which version of Windows your device is currently running, select the **Start** button, then select **Settings  > System > About**.

To ensure that Windows is up to date on your PC, select the **Start** button, then select **Settings > Windows Update**.  Select **Check for updates** and if updates are available, install them.

Check out [Windows Update: FAQ](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-update-faq-8a903416-6f45-0718-f5c7-375e92dddeb2) for more information on keeping your PC up to date.

## Make sure your PC is connected to the internet

Check that your PC is connected to the internet through a stable and secure ethernet or Wi-Fi connection. Check out [Connect to a Wi-Fi network in Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/connect-to-a-wi-fi-network-in-windows-1f881677-b569-0cd5-010d-e3cd3579d263) for more information on connecting your Windows PC to Wi-Fi. 

## Make sure you have a compatible GPU driver

Your PC requires a WDDM 2.2 or later graphics driver in order to complete the Windows Mixed Reality setup process. If your PC doesn't already have a compatible GPU driver, try these resources:

* Check for the latest critical driver updates using **Windows Update** by selecting **Start > Settings > Windows Update > Check for Updates**.
* Check for the latest optional driver updates using **Device Manager**:
    1. Right-click **Start > Device Manager**.
    2. Expand **Display Adapters**.
    3. Right-click on the graphics card and select **Update Driver > Search automatically for drivers**.
* Check the website for the manufacturer of your PC.
* Check the website for the manufacturer of your graphics card (for example, [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us), [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support), or [Intel](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download-center/home.html)).

## Make sure that you have any required adapters

Your PC may not have the full-sized video ports and/or USB ports required to connect your HMD. Additionally, you might also need a Bluetooth adapter to meet the [Mixed Reality Portal](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/mixed-reality-portal/9NG1H8B3ZC7M?hl=en-us&gl=US) requirements and successfully connect your HMD and motion controllers to your PC. 

Make sure to review the [Recommended adapters](recommended-adapters-for-windows-mixed-reality-capable-pcs.md) page to review the list of supported adapter types, information on port compatibility, and recommended adaptor models.

## Make sure that you have the necessary input devices

Windows Mixed Reality is designed to work best with Windows Mixed Reality supported motion controllers, which provide precise interactions and tracking without the need to install external tracking hardware on your walls. 

You can also use an Xbox gamepad or a mouse and keyboard.

## Make sure that you have a large, open space to support your virtual room boundary

To safely move around while using Windows Mixed Reality, you'll need to have a large open space for your virtual room boundary.  During initial setup, you'll be asked to choose between "Set me up for all experiences" or "Set me up for seated and standing". Choose "Set me up for all experiences" and set up a room boundary if you plan to move around in room-scale experiences. Review the [Windows Mixed Reality health, safety, and comfort guidelines](wmr-health-safety-comfort.md) to better understand the space requirements.

### Seated and standing (doesn't require room boundary)

If you select "Set me up for seated and standing," you'll be using your HMD without a boundary. This means you'll need to stay in one location when using the HMD to avoid any physical obstacles or potential tripping hazards. You'll still be able to sit down and stand up with this setup, but you shouldn't move around. Certain apps may require a room boundary and might not work or provide the same experience if you attempt to use them without one.

### All experiences (requires room boundary)

If you choose "Set me up for all experiences," you'll set up a room boundary and be able to move around in room-scale app experiences. Prepare your physical space by making sure there are no obstacles, hazards, or fragile items within the area you’ll be active - including above your head. 

>[!Important]
>Don’t set up at your room boundary on top of a staircase or under an extra-low ceiling fan. Remove breakables and obstacles from the area, and make sure everyone using your headset reads and understands the [health, safety, and comfort guidelines](wmr-health-safety-comfort.md).
