      - question: |
          Is there a specific order I should follow to connect my headset cables to a PC
        answer: |
          HP Recommends:
          
          - Connect the 6-meter cable to the headset first before connecting to the PC or power supply.
          - Leave the 6-meter cable connected to the headset after initial installation.
          - When the headset isn't in use, disconnect the power adapter from the 6-meter cable.
          
      - question: |
          What should I do to get a crisper image
        answer: |
          There are a few things you can try if you feel that your display looks a little blurry:
          
          - Make sure that your headset is on your head correctly with your eyes centered to the lenses.
          - Try to adjust the IPD (interpupillary distance). Reverb G2 uses a hardware IPD. To change it, look for IPD adjustment on your headset.
          - If you need glasses or contacts, you'll need to wear them when using the device.
          - Check that your lenses are clean (microfiber cloth only – no fluids).
          - Because of the advanced headset design, there may be some minor image ghosting in the first few minutes when starting the device while cold until the LCDs have the opportunity to warm up.
          
      - question: |
          I am getting a 7-14 “Something Went Wrong” error when I plug in my headset
        answer: |
          The 7-14 Something Went Wrong code means that some of the required USB2 components weren’t found.  Because of the extra-long cable of the HP Reverb G2, some of the tolerances for the USB signals are tighter.  This means that one port on your computer may work more reliably than another.
          
          If you're seeing a 7-14 “something went wrong” error, try the following steps:
          
          - Make sure that you have the most recent drivers installed for your headset and your USB controller.
          - Make sure you're using a Microsoft USB driver. There should be a “Microsoft” in the name of the "eXtensible Host Controller" device.
          - Try plugging the cable into a different USB-3.0 port on your computer. (Try USB Type-C and Type-A ports)
          - Use the included USB C to A adapter to try different ports.
          - Try plugging the headset in through a USB Hub to your computer.

      - question: |
          I am getting a 13-14 “Something Went Wrong” error when my PC resumes from hibernate (S4)
        answer: |
          Sometimes during the resume process, the video card can't establish a connection, so unplugging the USB Type C from your PC and plugging it back in may help to establish a connection.

      - question: |
          My HP Motion Controller joystick will sometimes stick to one side
        answer: |
          This issue is corrected by fully depressing the joystick until it clicks and it will move freely.

      - question: |
          Others state I am loud or that my audio is clipping while I am using the microphone with some applications
        answer: |
          The input volume levels are automatically set to 100% when the HP Reverb G2 microphone is first recognized by a Windows PC. Because of the Reverb G2's high-quality microphones, input sensitivity is much higher than the default Windows 10 settings expect. We recommend setting the Reverb G2 microphone input level starting at 50% and scale up from there. An optimal setting is specific to the user, especially when using applications that don't have an “auto-gain” microphone setting. Examples of applications that have “auto-gain” are Skype, Zoom, Teams, and Cisco WebEx, but not all VR social or broadcasting applications have this feature.

      - question: |
          The Mixed Reality Portal says “Can't run mixed reality on this headset” but this worked fine with my previous WMR headset
        answer: |
          This may happen because your HP Reverb G2 requires a more powerful PC to ensure the best experience. For more information, please review the minimum [PC requirements](windows-mixed-reality-minimum-pc-hardware-compatibility-guidelines.md)
          
      - question: |
          It looks like my left display is stretched, and the right display is off-centered and half black
        answer: |
          This can happen when your headset isn't running at the native resolution. Because of the nature of the high-resolution displays in the HP Reverb G2 HMD, not all systems can render the native resolution. There's a fix coming in a future Windows Update that will address the rendering issue when the headset isn't at the native resolution.
          
          There are a few reasons why your system isn't able to render at the native resolution:
          
          - The DisplayPort on the system might not be 1.3 compatible, or it might not support all four lanes.
          - If you're using an adapter, it might not support be HBR3 compatible, or it might not support all four lanes.
          - If your system has a hybrid GPU, that might be limiting the bandwidth available to the DisplayPort.
          
      - question: |
          Why are my HP Motion Controller models not showing up correctly in a game
        answer: |
          While most games don't display the controllers or use the models installed by the driver, some games use their own versions of the controller models, either to customize them or to display contextual help for the available inputs. Usually, this doesn't block any features of the games but might lead to confusion or even visual artifacts. This can only be fixed with an update of the game itself.

      - question: |
          My SteamVR games don't appear to work correctly with my HP Motion controllers
        answer: |
          While developers are working to update their games for HP Motion Controller compatibility, we have provided custom controller bindings for many of the most popular games on Steam. With "Windows Mixed Reality for SteamVR" fully updated to version 1.2.444, these bindings should be picked up automatically when your game is running. However, if your game doesn't seem to register your actions at this time, you can manually search for custom binding profiles using the SteamVR Settings menu.
          To do this
          
          - Open the SteamVR menu by pressing the right motion controller's menu button
          - Select the "Settings" icon in the bottom-right corner of the SteamVR menu
          - Select the "Controllers" tab
          - Select the "Manage Controller Bindings" option
          
          From here, you can change your active controller binding to "Custom", which will open up the option to try community-shared game bindings.
          If no custom game bindings have been shared for this game yet (or if you aren't fully satisfied with the ones you've tried), you can also create your own custom game bindings, and even help the rest of the community by sharing them after a few game sessions.
          
      - question: |
          I have all cables connected to the headset and PC but it won’t turn on
        answer: |
          Verify the cable connected to the headset is fully seated. There is a small dot on the top of the cable that will line up next to the top edge of the headset when it has been fully inserted:
          
          ![Small dot on the top of the cable](images/small-dot.jpg)
          
      - question: |
          How can I power down the headset while still using my PC
        answer: |
          Unplug the AC connection adapter from the link box on the headset cable to remove power to the headset.

      - question: |
          The image of the displays of the Reverb G2 is smaller and only in the upper left
        answer: |
          If you have an AMD power GPU, you'll need to disable the automatic upscaling. While your headset is connected, navigate to Settings -> Mixed Reality -> Headset -> Resolution.
          In the drop down menu select  “4320 x 2160 (best quality)” option. When “Automatic upscaling (best performance)” is selected, you may experience the issue with display.
