# Using Speech in Windows Mixed Reality

You can use your voice to get around Windows Mixed Reality faster. Taking a quick photo, opening an app, even teleporting without a controller are all a word away. For an easy way to type, try dictation mode on the mixed reality keyboard.

## See it, say it

In the Windows Mixed Reality home, if you see a word, you can often use it as a speech command. For instance, just say the name of a button to select it. If you don’t see a name, point your motion controller at the button to find out what to say. For Xbox gamepads, rest your gaze on the button.

## General speech commands

Use the following speech commands throughout Windows Mixed Reality to get around faster. Some commands use the gaze cursor, which you’ll bring up by saying “select.”

| To do this | Say this |
| --- | --- |
| Select | Say “select” to bring up the gaze cursor. Then, turn your head to position the cursor on the thing you want to select, and say “select” again. |
| Open the Start menu | Go to Start |
| Leave an immersive app | Say "Go to Start" to bring up the quick actions menu, then say "Mixed reality home." |
| Turn Flashlight on/off | Flashlight on / Flashlight off |
| Teleport | Turn your head toward the place you want to go, and then say “teleport.” (For more precise targeting, first say “select” to bring up the gaze cursor, then say “teleport.”) |
| Turn to the left or right | Turn left / turn right |
| Turn 180 degrees | Turn around |
| Move forward | Move forward / walk forward |
| Back up | Move back / walk back |
| Move to the left | Move left / walk left |
| Move to the right | Move right / walk right |

## 3D object commands

Gaze at a 3D object, hologram, or app window to use these commands:

| To do this | Say this |
| --- | --- |
| Make it bigger | Bigger |
| Make it smaller | Smaller |
| Turn it to face you | Face me |
| Get it ready to move - it will follow your gaze | Move this |
| Place it when you're done moving it | Place |

| Increase/decrease volume | Turn the volume up/down |

## Keyboard dictation

Switch to dictation mode anytime the keyboard is active for an easy way to type. Select microphone  on the keyboard—or just say “start dictating”—to get started.

> [!NOTE]
> The mixed reality keyboard is only available in English, but you can use dictation in any of the supported [Windows Mixed Reality languages](other-questions.md#what-languages-are-supported-in-windows-mixed-reality).

### Keyboard dictation commands

| To do this | Say this |
| --- | --- |
| Close the keyboard | Close |
| Start dictation | Start dictating |
| Stop dictation | Stop dictating |
| Delete what you've dictated | Delete that |
| Select everything in the dictation box | Select all |

### Punctuation

You’ll need to say the names of the punctuation you want to use. For instance, you might say "Hey **comma** what are you up to **question mark**."

Here are the punctuation keywords you can use:

* Period, comma, question mark, exclamation point/exclamation mark
* New line/new paragraph
* Semicolon, colon
* Open quote(s), close quote(s)
* Hashtag, smiley/smiley face, frowny, winky
* Dollar, percent

Sometimes it's helpful to spell out things like email addresses. For instance, to dictate example@outlook.com, you'd say "E X A M P L E at outlook dot-com."

To stop dictating, select **Done**.
