# Plug in your headset

## Connect your headset to your PC's USB 3.0 port

Identify the USB 3.0 port on your computer and plug in the USB cable. USB 3.0 ports have SS (Super Speed) written next to them. They're often blue, but not always.

If you don't have enough open USB ports on your PC, you can use an [AC-powered external USB 3.0 hub](recommended-adapters-for-windows-mixed-reality-capable-pcs.md#using-external-usb-30-hubs-with-windows-mixed-reality-headsets).

## Connect your headset to your PC's HDMI out port

Identify the HDMI out port on your computer and plug in the headset's HDMI cable. Make sure you **aren't** plugging into the HDMI in port!

## Connect headphones to your headset

Unless you purchased a device with integrated AKG headphones and dual-array microphone, like a Samsung HMD Odyssey headset, HP Reverb, or HP Reverb G2, you'll need headphones with a 3.5-mm audio jack.

## Common issues

* You plugged in the HDMI cable before plugging in the USB 3.0 cable.  Make sure that you plug in the USB 3.0 cable **before** plugging in the HDMI cable.
* You plugged in a bluetooth adapter next to your HMD's USB cable. **Don't** plug in your headset's USB cable next to a Bluetooth adapter because the resulting radio interference may negatively impact Bluetooth performance.
* You plugged in your HDMI cable to your iGPU HDMI port instead of your dGPU HDMI port for PCs that have both. Some Desktop PCs have both an integrated graphics processing unit (iGPU) and a discrete graphics processing unit (dGPU). iGPU ports are often disabled. If your PC has a dGPU, your headset needs to be plugged into the dGPU.  
* If your PC doesn't have an HDMI port, you may need an adapter. [View the full list of recommended adapters here](recommended-adapters-for-windows-mixed-reality-capable-pcs.md).
* You're connecting your headset to a Surface device. Read [using Surface with Windows Mixed Reality](windows-mixed-reality-minimum-pc-hardware-compatibility-guidelines.md#windows-mixed-reality-and-surface).
