# Marketing & Advertisement

More businesses have been discovering various new and exciting ways to generate high-engagement, unique advertisements by harnessing the immersive power of virtual reality. Immersive ads have the potential to improve a range of display ad metrics, such as generating increased engagement and interaction rates, producing higher-quality product or service impressions, decreasing bounce rates, and significantly increasing brand recognition and recallability.
 
## Immersive marketing and advertising: What it is and how it works

People often respond best to an advertisement that engages them directly and appeals to their interests. The virtual reality medium has proven to be an extraordinarily flexible tool in helping businesses find new ways to reach potential customers. 

In virtual reality marketing, one can create in-app advertisements and signage that cleanly blends into digital worlds filled with countless virtual users. These experiences can be fully tailor-made to build from the ground up by implementing virtual reality into either new or long-standing marketing portfolios. Virtual reality marketing has proven its effectiveness in bringing people closer to products and services, even more so than traditional forms of marketing.

## Setting up, deploying, and managing immersive marketing and advertising experiences. 

### What solutions does the Windows Mixed Reality platform have to assist with configuring virtual play spaces for use with immersive marketing and advertisement experiences? 

Many VR experiences require setting up a play space to use them safely. Play spaces are designated real-world spaces that have been cleared of obstacles and deemed safe to use VR in, corresponding to the player’s location in virtual space to prevent them from colliding with anything in the real world. For guidance on setting up simple room boundaries up to 5mx5m, see the [set up your room boundary](set-up-windows-mixed-reality.md#set-up-your-room-boundary) documentation. For guidance on setting up larger and more complex play spaces by utilizing the Spatial Anchors capability in the Windows Holographic API stack, visit the [coordinate systems](/windows/mixed-reality/design/coordinate-systems) documentation.  
 
### How can the Windows Mixed Reality platform and Azure Cloud Services assist with managing and deploying immersive marketing and advertisement experiences? 

Azure-based onsite and remote management can help your business scale your immersive marketing and advertisement experiences. Visit the [Cloud Services & Azure FAQ](enterprise-lbe-faq.md#cloud-services--azure-faq) to learn more.
